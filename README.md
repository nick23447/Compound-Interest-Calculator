### Welcome to the Compound Interest Calculator!

This web app allows you to input values in order to see the growth of your money over time. These values are:
* Principal (p): The amount of money that you have available to invest initially.

* Interest Rate (r): The annual interest rate.

* Compound Frequency (n): The times per year that interest will be compounded.

* Time (t): The length of time, in years, that you plan to save.




#### But what is Compound Interest?

Basically, it's the interest you earn on interest. 
With a savings account that earns compound interest, you earn interest on the initial amount deposited and on the interest that accumulates over time. This makes it much more valuable than simple interest, which only pays interest on the deposit.
